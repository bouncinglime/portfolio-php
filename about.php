		<!-- Description -->
		<label>Summary</label>
		<text>
		<br />Highly-organized woman-in-tech looking for interesting puzzles to solve, especially in Service Design. My artistic upbringing instilled a keen eye for aesthetics and creative solutions, and I am now interested in turning those talents to creating efficient ways for people to move through spaces. Always willing to dig deeper to find the roots of problems, I bring a collection of abilities that open new perspectives, both globally and at the implementation level. I specialize in creative thinking and problem-solving, with a strong emphasis on accuracy and efficiency.

		<br /><label>Personal Interests</label>
		<text>
			<br />Looking for opportunities to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world.
			<br />As a short person, I stand on many soap boxes. A partial list, in no particular order :
			<ul>
				<li>access to education</li>
				<li>climate change</li>
				<li>medicine and vaccination</li>
				<li>human rights</li>
				<li>digital rights</li>
				<li>intellectual property</li>
				<li>the intersection of arts and technology</li>
				<li>wilderness survival</li>
				<li>outdoor exploration</li>
				<li>experiential learning</li>
				<li>music and dance</li>
				<li>how access to the arts will save humanity</li>
				<li>the best empathy-building exercise is to work retail</li>
				<li>everyone should work in a commercial food space at some point</li>
			</ul>
			<br />I am hoping that my next move will take me in a direction to assist with positive, global, social change.

Our best-known works are Dance Dance Immolation (in the Guinness World Records as "World's Hottest Videogame"), Syzygryd (a 2.5 ton collaborative musical instrument that breathes fire), 2&Pi;r (a blisteringly interactive large-scale fire toy), and the Ardent Mobile Cloud Platform (a glowing pixelated cloud that will rain on your parade).

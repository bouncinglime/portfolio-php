		<text>
			<br />A complex project involving making four identical scrollwork pieces then fitting them together around a central post. There are two different sizes of scroll on each of the four pieces creating the top that holds the candle and the feet of the whole piece. Not only must the scrolls be identical but the whole pieces must be as well. An exercise in patience.
			<br />Fitting the finished pieces together is all precision and timing. Some metal flakes off every time a piece is heated, so that must be taken into account for the fitting. You only have a limited amount of time to work a piece while it's hot before having to reheat it, so everything needs to be planned and laid out in advance.

		  <br /><strong>Photo soon.</strong>
		  <br />The idea was to create an iron dragonboat paddle, made from scrap rebar, that would serve as a wall-mounted rack. After many failed attempts at making a correct paddle shape, this is the best one I have made so far.
		  <br />The next challenge is to figure out how to mount it to a block that can be hung on the wall.
